### 1. Ability to serve the number of people

Being aware of the number of guests is something that must come before deciding on the location of the ceremony. After all, you need to make sure that the chosen place has the proper infrastructure to provide comfort to the guests. This includes accessibility for possible guests with reduced mobility or visually impaired, for example. In addition to being a place that can be easily found by guests.

### 2. Security

Although it is often overlooked, taking this into account is very important. So, in addition to observing if the place of the ceremony holds all the guests, it is essential to prevent and observe the existence of emergency exits, fire brigade, generator included etc.

Also, establish guarantees in case of cancellation and make a contract with all the details agreed, from the basics to technical specifications. All of this counts so that the couple does not go through unnecessary frustrations and enjoy their day better.

### 3. Budget

Financial organization is also an essential step in avoiding problems. Keep in mind that if the budget is smaller, investing absurd amounts where the wedding will take place may compromise other services that are also necessary, such as buffet, decoration, etc. So, the recommendation is to set aside about 10% of the budget for renting the space.

### 4. Wedding style

This is another detail that must be taken into account before deciding where the wedding will be, since the location must be based on the style of the ceremony. So, if your goal is a more sophisticated and classic wedding, there are places like museums, old mansions and even luxury hotels that already have an architecture and decoration that meet this style. However, if you do a more vintage or rustic style, the places, beaches, bistros and restaurants can guarantee a perfect harmony in the decoration.

So, did you realize how important it is to take different details into consideration before looking for wedding venues? Usually, with the euphoria of the preparations for the ceremony, some essential points can be overlooked, such as ensuring accessible places. So, keep an eye out.
